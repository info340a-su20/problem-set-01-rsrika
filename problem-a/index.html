            <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>
        </h1>
        <img src="img/toph.jpg" alt="An image of Toph from Avater: The Last Airbender smiling">
        <p>Toph is an earthbender from
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender.</a>
            She was born blind, so she has to rely on her
                    earthbending and other senses in order to 'see'. She is very talented and does not let her disability limit her. She invented two other forms of bending,
                    including metalbending and seismic sense, both of which were previously seen as impossible.
